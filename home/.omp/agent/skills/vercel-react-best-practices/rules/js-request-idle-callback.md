## Defer Non-Critical Work with requestIdleCallback

**Impact: MEDIUM (keeps UI responsive during background tasks)**

Use `requestIdleCallback()` to schedule non-critical work during browser idle periods. This keeps the main thread free for user interactions and animations, reducing jank and improving perceived performance.

**Incorrect (blocks main thread during user interaction):**

```typescript
function handleSearch(query: string) {
  const results = searchItems(query)
  setResults(results)

  // These block the main thread immediately
  analytics.track('search', { query })
  saveToRecentSearches(query)
  prefetchTopResults(results.slice(0, 3))
}
```

**Correct (defers non-critical work to idle time):**

```typescript
function handleSearch(query: string) {
  const results = searchItems(query)
  setResults(results)

  // Defer non-critical work to idle periods
  requestIdleCallback(() => {
    analytics.track('search', { query })
  })

  requestIdleCallback(() => {
    saveToRecentSearches(query)
  })

  requestIdleCallback(() => {
    prefetchTopResults(results.slice(0, 3))
  })
}
```

**With timeout for required work:**

```typescript
// Ensure analytics fires within 2 seconds even if browser stays busy
requestIdleCallback(
  () => analytics.track('page_view', { path: location.pathname }),
  { timeout: 2000 }
)
```

**Chunking large tasks:**

```typescript
function processLargeDataset(items: Item[]) {
  let index = 0

  function processChunk(deadline: IdleDeadline) {
    // Process items while we have idle time (aim for <50ms chunks)
    while (index < items.length && deadline.timeRemaining() > 0) {
      processItem(items[index])
      index++
    }

    // Schedule next chunk if more items remain
    if (index < items.length) {
      requestIdleCallback(processChunk)
    }
  }

  requestIdleCallback(processChunk)
}
```

**With fallback for unsupported browsers:**

```typescript
const scheduleIdleWork = window.requestIdleCallback ?? ((cb: () => void) => setTimeout(cb, 1))

scheduleIdleWork(() => {
  // Non-critical work
})
```

**When to use:**

- Analytics and telemetry
- Saving state to localStorage/IndexedDB
- Prefetching resources for likely next actions
- Processing non-urgent data transformations
- Lazy initialization of non-critical features

**When NOT to use:**

- User-initiated actions that need immediate feedback
- Rendering updates the user is waiting for
- Time-sensitive operations


**OMP correction/caveat:** Idle callbacks are best-effort and may never run before page termination; timeout does not guarantee delivery within two seconds. Do not use for required audit/security work. The simple fallback does not provide IdleDeadline to chunking callbacks.
